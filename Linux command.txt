Read File split
================
ZIP, UNZIP and SPLIT the large files 

1.	Login into Thames VDI Profile.
2.	Open Putty and enter the SIT Environment of Hostname or IP address
3.	Login with your Service account in SIT Environment
4.	Go to path BSS/app/swm/dropzone/rni/sit/in/data/processed
5.	In this path you can find the meter read report files
6.	Copy that file to tmp folder
7.	Why I mentioned tmp folder because getting permission denied in BSS/app/swm/dropzone/rni/sit/in/data/processed in this path.

8.	Once you copied the file to tmp folder use below command in the same folder
9.	ZIP the File:
10.	Zip XYZ.zip XYZ and press enter
12.	UNZIP the file:
14.	Unzip XYZ.zip and press enter
16.	SPLIT the FILE:
Go to tmp path and enter this command
Split xyz.csv or xyz.txt and press enter
Now the file will convert into to files like xaa and xbb
For example, if the file has large lines like 1000 lines, if you want convert to split the file use below commands
Split files with customize line numbers (-l)
Let’s suppose we want to split a file with customize line numbers, let say I want max 200 lines per file.
To achieve this, use  ‘-l’ option in split command.
split -l200 xyz.txt --verbose
creating file ‘xaa’
creating file ‘xab’
creating file ‘xac’
creating file ‘xad’
creating file ‘xae’
